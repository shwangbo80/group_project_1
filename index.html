                        <h4 class="uk-card-title">Sweet</h4>
                        <p class= "uk-text-bold">The sweet flavor profile is one of the most desirable and pleasurable flavor profiles many people love to indulge in. Sweet can come from foods naturally such as apples having sugar properties or can be added in foods such as cakes, candy, and ice cream.</p>

                        <h4 class="uk-card-title">Salty</h4>
                        <p class= "uk-text-bold">Food containing table salt is mainly what we taste as salty. The chemical basis of this taste is salt crystal, which consists of sodium and chloride. Mineral salts like the salts of potassium or magnesium can also cause a sensation of saltiness.</p>

                        <p class= "uk-text-bold">Another flavor is bitterness. Bitterness is going to have more of a pungent taste many scientists believe was an evolutionary feature where it was necessary to taste poisonous plants or food that could be harmful to humans. The type of foods that hold a bitter flavor are foods like citrus peel, cruciferous vegetables (kale, broccoli, brussel sprouts, etc.), and cranberries. </p>

                            <h4 class="uk-card-title">Sour</h4>
                            <p class= "uk-text-bold">The taste of sour is one of the more interactive flavor profiles people run into. Typically, when a person comes across something sour it causes your mouth to pucker and salivate.  It is primarily the result of acids such as citric acid, lactic acid, malic acid, oxalic acid, and ascorbic acid in our foods. Foods that have sourness to them are lemons, grapes, sauerkraut, and buttermilk.</p>

                                <h4 class="uk-card-title">Umami</h4>
                                <p class= "uk-text-bold">Umami is the fifth profile of taste many people do not know about still. It was talked about by Japanese scientists in the early 1900’s it did not finally get recognized until early 2000’s.  This flavor profile can be said to be more of a savory taste that can be grouped into the salty profile but can stand alone. Umami can be found in more of the Asian cuisines because chemically it is glutamate which many Asian cuisines use. </p>

                       <p class= "uk-text-bold">Lastly one of the more daring flavor profiles is spicy.  It can bring an intense sensation for a short period of time or last for awhile.  Spice can really bring out the flavor in cuisines. Some people can handle more spice than others so take that into account when diving into certain types of foods or adding sauces to your meals. Some spices include: peppers, garlic, cumin, and paprika.</p>

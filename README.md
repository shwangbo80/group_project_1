# Project 2

Group Name: Scrum Dog Millionaires

Project Name: Pre-Game (Working Name)

Proposal: We are building an app for concert goers or sports fans to look for restaurants in the area of their venues. Many venues have sub-par food, do no offer food or are in areas of quality restaurants with numerous options of food it can become overwhelming. This is where our app comes in play helping users search their venue or even search an area using Seat Geek to plan an outing and give them restaurant choices.

Our app is designed partly for spontaneous people who decided on a whim to go to a ball game, concert, or event by taking out the stress of finding a place to eat before or after their event. The other aspect of the site is for those who have already purchased their tickets to an event can just search the venue itself and find restaurants around it rather than having to look up the venueâ€™s address and then go to another website to enter it in to find food choices.

We feel this is important because one of the best things about going to any sort of event is to find a good place to eat. In highly populated areas there are two key factors that went into our thoughts about building this app: people going to this venue or area for the first time, and the sheer volume of restaurants.

This app makes it much easier to plan out a trip and get an idea of what places are the best around their respective areas. Food is not just a necessity, but it serves as an experience whether it be trying something new or being able to hangout with friends and talk about what just happened at your event or how excited you are going. We feel that combining the two in the same place makes it easier and less stressful on people so they can look forward to their event and not worry about trying to plan out dinner.

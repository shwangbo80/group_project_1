# group_project_1
Master branch repo for group project 1

We were tasked on building an app that pulls from two different API's. Our group decided on building a website that users can input their
city or a city they will be visiting to get an idea of restaurants and events in the area. Users will search their city and the city will
populate a list of events with links to purchase tickets, and a list of restaurants in the area to help plan a nighn our site we
have some information to help out users such as popular venues and flavor profiles to help users get some ideas.
